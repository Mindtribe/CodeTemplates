Eclipse Code Style and Template

--- r3 ---

* Updated for Eclipse Juno
* Updated file comments with minor modifications to the target default and
  authors (attempts to better support multiple authors)
* Updated style to:
    * Wrap conditional expressions only when necessary
    * (C++) Start initializer list on a new line (seems easier to read)
    * Indent scope blocks in case statements. These are rare and ugly, but
      indenting them makes them easier to read when they exist (usually to 
      declare locals inside of a case)


--- r2 ---

* Tweaked line-wrapping for initializers to preserve wrapping (if possible)


--- r1 ---

* Initial Release
* Exported from Eclipse Indigo
