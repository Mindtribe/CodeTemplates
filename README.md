Mindtribe's Official Code Templates

Templates for the Eclipse IDE are found in Eclipse_Templates. These include the following files:

* **MindTribe C_C++ Code Style.xml** - This is a formatter template for Eclipse. It defines our preferred spacing, etc.
* **MindTribe C_C++ Code Templates_BSD-Default.xml** - This contains C/C++ file templates with our open source BSD license selected as the default. Use this if you are working on open source Mindtribe projects.
* **MindTribe C_C++ Code Templates_MT-Default.xml** - This contains C/C++ file templates with our proprietary license selected as the default. Use this if you are working on closed source Mindtribe projects or client projects. In the case of client projects, be sure to change the copyright to the client's name when creating new files.
