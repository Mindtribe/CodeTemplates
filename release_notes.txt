Code Templates

--- r8 ---

* Updated for Eclipse Mars
* No change to code style or file comments

  one now defaults to the BSD License when creating new files and one
  defaults to the MT Copyright only.

--- r4 ---

* No change to code style
* Added C++03/C99/C90 file comments with versions for MindTribe BSD license
  and copyright only


--- r3 ---

* Updated for Eclipse Juno
* Updated file comments with minor modifications to the target default and
  authors (attempts to better support multiple authors)
* Updated style to:
    * Wrap conditional expressions only when necessary
    * (C++) Start initializer list on a new line (seems easier to read)
    * Indent scope blocks in case statements. These are rare and ugly, but
      indenting them makes them easier to read when they exist (usually to
      declare locals inside of a case)


--- r2 ---

* Tweaked line-wrapping for initializers to preserve wrapping (if possible)


--- r1 ---

* Initial Release
* Exported from Eclipse Indigo
